# GUI
Uni task

Write a Python program using the GUI framework tkinter to manage some information about your courses at the University. The layout of the GUI should be as shown (or similar) in the next page. It consists of a Main menu, where the user can create a new file (“new semester”) load an existing data file or save the changed data back to the file. The data is saved in a csv file (one file per semester).
After the file is loaded, the list of courses is displayed on the left side. Two buttons above the list of courses enable adding new courses to the list and removing a selected course from the list. For each course, save the name of the course, your comments about the course and the number of hours spent for the course work. Use a Slider Widget to change the number of hours.

Minimum required functionality:
 Create a new file, open existing file, and save the file after editing data through the main menu.
 Add and remove courses through button clicks
 Change the name, comment and working hours of the selected course through Entry, Text and Slider widgets
